### Stock Market Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for conducting stock market analysis. The notebook includes the following features:

- **Data Retrieval**: Uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data for a specified company.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates line plots to visualize the closing prices of the stock over time using `matplotlib`.
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculates and visualizes moving averages (50-day and 200-day) to identify trends and smooth out price fluctuations.
- **Data Handling**: Employs `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Customization**: Allows users to specify different stock symbols and date ranges for analysis.

The notebook serves as a practical guide for anyone looking to analyze stock market data, visualize trends, and apply technical analysis techniques.
